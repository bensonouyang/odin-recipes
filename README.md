# odin-recipes

There are 3 recipes: Tequila Slow-Cooked Beef Enchiladas, Chef John's Blueberry Dutch Baby, Sheet Pan Ratatouille.

Each recipe page contains a description, ingredients, and the steps.

The skills that I have demostrated in this project is using headers, adding paragraphs, making unordered and ordered lists, linking to different pages from the index.html file, and uploading an image on 
the page.
